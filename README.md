A Smart Car parking system solution for today's problems


Rapid advancements in technology made people to move into urban areas, increase in personal vehicles caused congestion in cities. Finding a free parking lot has become a hectic issue.
An Iot based cloud computing approach was proposed to determine the status of parking lots 
To overcome the shortcomings of cloud based approach fog computing was proposed which is used to decrease the latency and network usage of cloud. 
It uses a three tier architecture where first tier uses IR sensor to send the data to fog nodes, second tier uses Fog computing to identify free parking lots and third is connected to the cloud to store the data.
The fog computing decreases the latency by processing the data and transmits an appropriate action swiftly.
